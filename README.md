# all_conf
This project mainly contains some configurations.  
The different folders have different configurations.  

## Linux
To use linux well, it's necessary to do something as follows:
+ install vim(the file **.vimrc** is useful in this project)
+ update the GCC to the newest version
+ install shadowsocks
+ markdown

## sublime
Use it mainly for c/c++. Hence, it's necessary to have a good configuration so that we can directly compile and run the code.
+ sublime_c++
